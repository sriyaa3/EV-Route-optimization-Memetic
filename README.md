- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning algorithms
- Optimization techniques

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `AI_Project (2).ipynb`
3. Run the cells to execute the EV route optimization algorithm

## Installation

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
# Add other required packages as needed
```

## Usage
